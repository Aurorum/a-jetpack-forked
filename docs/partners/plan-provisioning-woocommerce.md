# Provisioning Woo Commerce Extensions
If your Jetpack hosting partner account supports creating WooCommerce Extensions through the Jetpack hosting partner program, this document provides additional information.

All other [documentation](plan-provisioning-direct-api.md) provided for the Jetpack partner hosting program is the same and valid for WooCommerce extension provisioning, except the plan argument on a provisioning request will need to change. At the moment, WooCommerce extension bundles are hosting partner specific, so please get in touch with us to get your plan slug if you do not already have it.
