## Provisioning Plan
This relates to information found in [Provisioning a Plan](plan-provisioning-direct-api.md).

In order to provsion a WooCommerce Extension bundle when making a request to the endpoint the `plan` which is the slug representing the plan to be provisioned will need to be set to your hosting partner WooCommerce extension provisioning slug. If you aren't sure what this is or the plan type is identified as invalid please contact us.
